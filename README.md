# OCT Macular Super-Resolution

This project applies deep learning techniques to enhance the resolution of macular OCT retinal images.

## Objective
To improve visualization of the posterior segment (retina) using super-resolution methods for medical imaging.

## Methods Tried
- GAN-based super-resolution (ex: SRGAN, ESRGAN)
- Diffusion-based methods (planned or optional)

## Dataset
Heidelberg Spectralis OCT dataset (Posterior Segment - Retina)

## Tools and Frameworks
- Python
- PyTorch
- OpenCV

## Expected Outcome
Higher resolution macular OCT images suitable for clinical or research analysis.
